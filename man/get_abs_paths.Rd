\description{
Default argument values assume a directory structure that includes Dropbox
and is appropriate for the Fellowship project for Dr. Paul Brockway.
}
\details{
The default argument for \code{home_path} gets the value for \code{fs::path_home()}.

The default value for \code{drake_cache_folder} assumes that the \code{PFUSetup} folder
(this project's folder) is a sibling of the working directory
from which the drake workflow is run.
If this assumption is not true, users are free to
pass a non-default value into this function.
